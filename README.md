## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS pseudo-classes (hover states)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced how to build a clean and simple card layout using **semantic HTML** and **CSS Flexbox**.  
I also learned how to properly style hover states for better interactivity:

```css
.container div:nth-child(2) h1:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing:

- Accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, alt text usage).

- CSS grid layouts for more complex designs.

- Using rem units for better scalability.

### Useful resources

- MDN CSS documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) Helped me revisit some flexbox and gradient properties.

- [W3Schools HTML and CSS Tutorials] (https://www.w3schools.com)
